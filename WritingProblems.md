# Things important to know!!!!

I have never been a good writer, and I never will be, unless of course I start to follow these seven tips that I noticed in my and others’ experiences as a writer. 

1)Following the point 2)Deadlines  3)Rereading  4)How to accept criticism better 5)Don't forget the essentials 6)Paraphrasing and plagiarism 7)Search for your interest

But first, I will note that the word "good writer" for me means being able to grasp the attention and interest of readers. Of course, each of us has a piece of this talent that will grow with time and practice. And it is important to understand that without overcoming the barriers you face as a writer, it is impossible to achieve anything great through writing.

## I’m writing, writing. Hmm... writing what?

We sometimes get so deep into the process of writing that we forget what we are writing about or wanted to write about.

After that, we lose the meaning or waste time to remember this little detail to continue.

To avoid this situation, it’s better to take some time to write down all steps of your work. Once you have a premise for your essay/assignment, think about where it will go and create an outline. You might even want to come up with an end point and work backwards! This will help you get a sense of how the story will progress and how different events will be connected. If a new thought comes to mind, then pause the process and look at the notes. Couldn't this change what you originally planned to write. If not, then think carefully about where to put it: after an argument or in the middle of an essay. So it will be finer for you.Before that, I just thought that in the course of writing everything would work out for me and I would not get lost in my thoughts. But I soon realized that keeping notes of what to write, what exact quotations, and what to use helped me

## Dead by deadlines

Almost everyone hates deadlines. If the time allotted for an assignment is not sufficient to complete it satisfactorily, a student may be required to spend extra hours before and after work to try to meet the deadline. Thereby, deadlines cause stress and are a mental health hazard. But one more aspect, the problem of procrastination, which makes us leave work for tomorrow.

However, as professor Kruszewska said in her video:

“Deadlines encourage us to get work done”, there are many advantages of deadlines that make equality between pros and cons of it. 

So, how can we deal with that?  Of course, with planning, planning the period of time that is given to you to finish your assignment. Take time each day to finish some part of your work. Forget about the real deadline and set another deadline for yourself (it would be better if two days before the due date) that will make you finish early. As a result, you will enjoy your assignment submission, and feel a great deal of pleasure.


## Rereading
You should re-read your essay before submitting it to ensure that you have found any errors in it and corrected them.

After every reread, you will likely find something with which you are unsatisfied—be it the order of your paragraphs, the content, the word choice, etc. 

Besides, it is better to ask your friend or mate to peer-review your essay, ask what is missing, how can you improve that. So, you can realize you mistakes quickly.

## Criticism

     No one likes criticism as well as deadlines, but the both play necessary roles in our writing. Sometimes, after criticism, there is no desire to continue writing. Because you think that "if nobody likes your  writing(or maybe opinion) and everyone criticizes it, then why write it? I'd better do something useful for myself and in what I am better at." Moreover, after you see how others write so well and sweetly, you don't want to show your writing. This way you are criticizing yourself.  

BUT, you should keep in mind that “No one is born  “Good writer “'', it only comes with practice. So, listen honestly for a critic's intention and thank those who offer constructive criticism. It will make you understand your flaws, and work on them.

By time, with the progress you will start to clearly see your past mistakes and cringe for it

By the way, make an appointment with your professor every week and ask everything that bothers you. It will make you feel more confident in your further writings.

Don't forget the essentials: citations etc. Better to note them before writing

Before submitting your assignment, make sure that there is everything written; citations, references, the header. Because  you will lose big points if you miss to write them!!! I usually write all this first and then start writing an essay, personally it is a more comfortable way to get done with writing.

## Paraphrasing and plagiarism

As a freshman like me, it is important to know that there is a big difference between plagiarism and paraphrasing. That plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or ideas without crediting the original author and thereby pretending it's your own. However, paraphrasing means rephrasing the original text in your own words.  Students make big mistakes by changing only a few words, replacing them with synonyms, and thinking that this is paraphrasing.

By the way, there is a good video which explains their difference accurately and teaches how to do paraphrasing correctly.

## Search for your interest not others!

With the desire to grab the attention of readers, we forget why for us, writers this essay should matter. Аnd in search of the readers' interest, we do not notice that our own interest is fading. Therefore, in order to start writing something, or when choosing a topic for writing, first ask the question - Will it interest you?

Look for what you need, what your writer soul needs. You must have a desire to write this work and a desire to finish it. 

I hope that this post will help you in some way.
